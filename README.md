## How to run the project

### Prerequirements
1. Download repo.
2. Create a mongoDB cluster in [MongoDB website](https://mongodb.com) and get the cluster url by following the instructions.
3. Download neo4j desktop application in [neo4j website](https://neo4j.com/download). After downloading the application, create a neo4j database with two following plugins added:
- Graph Data Science Library 2.3.2
- APOC 5.3.0
4. Create a Firebase Storage Project in [Firebase website](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage). After creating a project, go to the project settings and save the project ID. After this step, click on the service accounts tab in the settings and click on generate new private key button. This will generate and download a configuration file. Rename this file as `firebase-adminsdk.json`. This file should have the following fields:
```
"type": "service_account",
"project_id": "",
"private_key_id": "",
"private_key": "",
"client_email": "",
"client_id": "",
"auth_uri": "",
"token_uri": "",
"auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "",
"client_x509_cert_url": "",
"universe_domain": ""
``` 

### Run steps

Follow the steps in the given order.

**For Call Graph Server**
1. Add the your neo4j configurations to `src/main/resources/application.properties`. There should be four properties named `neo4j.uri`, `neo4j.username`, `neo4j.password`, and `firebase.projectId`. The first three of these configuration information should match with the neo4j database that you opened in the previous step, and the last one should be a valid Firebase storage project ID. An example configuration can be seen below:  
``` 
neo4j.uri=bolt://localhost:7687
neo4j.username=neo4j
neo4j.password=44e7d90c807a13a4817fb8c12ab0b6ce5af62741
firebase.projectId=change-impact-detector-xyzab
```
3. Put the previously generated `firebase-adminsdk.json` file under `src/main/resources/` 
4. Download dependencies using `mvn clean install`
5. Run the server using `mvn spring-boot:run`

**For Website**
1. Access ChangeImpactDetector/frontend directory using `cd ChangeImpactDetector/frontend` in root repo.
2. Download dependencies using `npm install` command.
3. Access ChangeImpactDetector/backend directory using `cd ChangeImpactDetector/backend` in root repo.
4. Download dependencies using `npm install` command.
5. Add mongoDB URL to `.env` file using this format `MONGO_URI=<your_mongoDB_connection_link>`.
6. Run the application using `npm run dev`. You should see the web application in `localhost:3005`.

**For GitHub Bot**
1. Access ChangeImpactDetectorBot directory using `cd ChangeImpactDetectorBot` in root repo.
2. Download dependencies using `npm install` command.
3. Run the ChangeImpactDetectorBot using `npm start` command.
4. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser
5. Select `Register GitHub App`. After click on this button without connection to any repository, close the bot application using `cmd + c`.
6. Now, you should see newly created `.env` file in root directory.
7. Add mongoDB URL to `.env` file using this format `MONGO_URI=<your_mongoDB_connection_link>`.
8. Again, run the bot using `npm start` command. 
9. Go to your GitHub account settings and click on `Developer Settings`.
10. In GitHub Apps section, select your bot and click on `Edit`.
11. Click on `Install App` button.
12. Select the repository you want to analyze in the opened tab and give permission to application.

After you add the repository, initial analysis will start automatically. Do not terminate the application. This can take a while depending on the selected project size.
Then, it will listen for the events that occurred in GitHub, as long as it is active. So, keep the program open to keep your analysis data recent.
